Image capture & Human Recognition
---------------------------------

- Every few seconds (determined by uploadEvery which defaults as 3) an image is sent to the brain. This image is stored in static/motionImages and shown in the web page

- If motion is recognised then an image is sent to the brain for object recognition. This image is stored in static/motionImages/[client_device_name]. 
  Currently this cannot be turned on/off

- If a face is recognised in the image then a chat will be triggered, and the faces list will be written to ENVIRON variable, and timer set to when the faces will be cleared from ENVIRON
  Currently this cannot be turned on/off
  
- If a person is detected (recognized or not) then actions will be taken depending on settings:
    If ENVIRON["motionTime"] has expired then ENVIRON["motionTime"] will be extended by ENVIRON["motionDelay"]
      And If ENVIRON["secureMode"] ==" True" then recording will be triggered on all connected devices by setting a value for ENVIRON["saveVideo"]
      And If ENVIRON["friendMode"] == "True" then chat will be triggered
